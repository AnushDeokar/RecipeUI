# RecipeUI

RecipeUI is rethinking how we use API tools like Postman or Insomnia. We're starting off with TypeScript powered API requests and API collections you can run in seconds!

## Built with

Couldn't have built this app without some really amazing packages

- 🐻 Zustand + immer for global state management
- 💨 Tailwind + 🌼 DaisyUI for making me build pretty and native html components
- 🔺 NextJS + Vercel for a seamless frontend framework and deployment package
- ⚡ Supabase for a seamless backend service that has many cool features.
- 🪞 Codemirror for the easy code editor plugin
- 🦖 Docusaurus for docs!
- Other fun stuff: pnpm, downshift, fuse, react18-json-view

Contributors

- @[dvtng] for the continuous feedback on system design and ux of the overall project


## Open source

We are open sourced because we use so much open source technology and we want to be transparent about how we actually make API requests. We don't store any API secrets in the cloud and we limit the telemetry we collect to the user experience portions.

## Running locally

Currently, we allow some support for running our desktop app built with Tauri Rust. Check out the readme at [apps/desktop](https://github.com/RecipeUI/RecipeUI/tree/main/apps/desktop)
